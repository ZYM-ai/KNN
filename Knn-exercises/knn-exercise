  This is my first touch on github, and i am going to do some exercises about knn-project.
Actually i have done this exercise on my another PC, so what i wanna do is to pull that exercise code 
done with jupyter notebook into this repository. Then, that make me can also view my code on github in my home 
and based on these exercises, i will keep on doing another exercise which is K-means i am supposed to be learning.
